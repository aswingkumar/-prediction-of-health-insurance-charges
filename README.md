# Prediction-of-Health-Insurance-Charges-using-regression
This is a health insurance charges prediction model that uses a linear regression algorithm to predict the health insurance charges of a person based on the given data. The dataset used for this tutorial is available on Kaggle and GitHub.
- This dataset contains detailed information about insurance customers, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status and region. Having access to such valuable insights allows analysts to get a better view into customer behaviour and the factors that contribute to their insurance charges. By understanding the patterns in this data set we can gain useful insight into how age,gender and lifestyle choices can affect a person's insurance premiums.
- This could be of great value when setting up an insurance plan or marketing campaigns that target certain demographics. Furthermore, this dataset provides us with an opportunity to explore deeper questions such as what are some possible solutions for increasing affordability when it comes to dealing with high charges for certain groups?
# It contains:

- Column name       	-        Description
- Age               	-        The age of the customer. (Integer)
- Children          	-        The number of children the customer has. (Integer)
- Smoker            	-       Whether or not the customer is a smoker. (Boolean)
- Region            	-       The region the customer lives in. (String)
- Charges           	-         The insurance charges for the customer. (Float)

# Workflow of Machine Learning Problem
1. Explore the data and find correlations between inputs and targets
2. Pick the right model, loss functions and optimizer for the problem at hand
3. Scale numeric variables and one-hot encode categorical data
4. Set aside a test set (using a fraction of the training set)
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions on the test set and compute the loss
